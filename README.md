# Twitter-data-analysis
In this project, I create an R package called 'twitter'.
The goal of 'twitter' is to search tweets about four movies, do the data cleaning and visualization, do the graphical visualizations and compare the popularity of different movies in different cities, get the timelines for each user, get the most frequent words for each movie and finally make a word cloud.
